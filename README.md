Creates report in excel from Google Analytics statistic.

It retrieves data from Google Analytics, import them into a DB for better reading and parsing and then it output them into Excel spreadsheet.
The aggregation of data is done according to personal needing.

It uses GAPI library http://code.google.com/p/gapi-google-analytics-php-interface/ to retrieve data from Google Analytics and PHPExcel library to create excel spreadsheet.
I do not own any copyright on GAPI nor PHPExcel.
